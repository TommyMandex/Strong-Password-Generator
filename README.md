# Strong-Password-Generator
Generates safe and strong passwords.

## Information
This was made to help you improve your security. A lot of people (including celebrities) are being hacked every day, and this is becoming a problem.
Ava Rose (a famous TikToker) was recently hacked and I asked myself "how?". Well, this action inspired me and made me take a deeper look at why and how she was hacked. Not only did her Instagram account get hacked, but also her Snapchat.

You might ask yourself, what consequences could this kind of a hack lead to? Well, this made the hacker able to see all her private DM's and also capable of contacting any of her friends using her account, view her private photos, shout himself out (the hacker gained 9K followers in 12h) and more.

## How did Ava Rose get hacked?
As the hacker got access to both her Instagram- and Snapchat account, I'm sure we can all agree on that the hacker either got access to her email and reset the passwords or she was using the same password on both platforms. So how did the hacker get access to her password(s)? Well, there are several ways of hacking a user. I am going to leave a few methods down below — I'm sure there are more methods but here are a few I just thought of and was possibly used to hack Ava Rose.

• Brute Force Attack — automate the process of trying different combinations of passwords. There are "most commonly used passwords" lists online that you could download. The list would most likely look something like this: "qwerty123, 123456789, passw0rd, ...". As these are easy to remember passwords, people tend to use these kind of passwords. But that is of course easy to brute force/guess which makes them bad passwords.<br/>
• Social Engineering — simple method to gain trust and collect data. You can for instance send a spoofed email (great example here: https://emkei.cz/) with the name of someone else (it could be a friend of the target) and include a keylogger, R.A.T (Remote Access Trojan) or a fake login page that sends you the account credentials the user inputs.<br/>
• Network Monitoring — capture network traffic. You should never use a public Wi-Fi in e.g. airports, cafés or restaurants if you care about your security. However, if you choose to connect to a public Wi-Fi then you should be careful and make sure you don't log in to any website/application or send sensitive information. That is simply because viewing network traffic is accessible by anyone who has the the correct tools and there are several tutorials of this online.<br/>
• Password Guessing — you can brute force and make the process quicker but if you have enough information of this person (e.g. date of birth, pets, school and interests) it would most likely only take a few tries. A lot of people tend to use the password form: {Name}{Year of Birth} as it is easy to remember and it's static unlike your age that increases every year. That is exactly why you should use a password generator like [this](https://github.com/zoony1337/Strong-Password-Generator/blob/master/main.py).<br/>
